The log of my #100DaysOfCode challenge. Started on [April 23, 2020]. Round 1 is for working with Jenkins in CI/CD deployments.

## Log

### R1D1 [April 23, 2020]
Configured Jenkins and Tomcat locally as I work through the Udemy course Jenkins Master Class.

### R1D2 [April 24, 2020]
Configured build pipeline to deploy from Git to Staging automatically and tied in manual process build for deploying to Production.

### R1D3 [April 25, 2020]
Configured pipeline jobs to be built with DSL, chaining build and deployment scripts to staging and production.

### R1D4 [April 26, 2020]
Rebuilt the Jenkins environment in DigitalOcean. Started moving all of the old Jenkins jobs over.

### R1D5 [April 27, 2020]
Completed DigitalOcean rebuild of Jenkins with all previous Jenkins projects. Added agent to the Primary and executed projects on agent. Began Docker setup.

### R1D6 [April 28, 2020]
Spent time executing Docker/Jenkins integrations and learning Docker commands necessary. Wasn't full amount of Docker integration but I will look at that on a separate pathway.
